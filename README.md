# Software Engineering Terminologies

This repo contains the most **frequent** terminologies used in the Software industry and its one liner explanation.

The repo will contain different documents for different roles and interests.

## Motivation

I always wished to find a single document with the commonly used expressions and terminologies in software industry, this document could have contributed massively in my early development as a Software Engineer.

And now after 10+ years in software development, read tens of books and watched tens of tutorials. Its time to create this document and utilise the power of the open source community to improve and maintain the document updated with the latest commonly used buzz words.

## Value

- This repo will help Software Engineers to get familiar with the commonly used terms. Those terms could be used in meetings, interviews, meetups, sessions and events.

- On top of that, those terms could be used to increase your knowledge and vocabulary.

- It might cover popular words that you didn't know.

## Contribution

Please feel free to raise a PR to edit or create a new document for a specific role or area of expertise.
